# Countries API Application - Version 0

## üëã Welcome!

Your challenge is to build a website with React.js that pulls country data from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) and displays it like the designs.

## üéØ Requirements for Version 0

- Mobile responsive application built with React.js and Vite
- Countries data is pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com), or from `data.json` file when the API is down
- As a user, I can see all countries from the API on the homepage, with data displayed about each country

## üîó Resources

- **Designs:** You will need to use this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/YuEMNteoQic0h6RRiYprpV/Countries-API-Project?node-id=1045-2&p=f&t=T2oSD2lU7TuxaG13-0) for the designs
- **Style Guide:** Refer to the `style-guide.md` file for info about the color palette, fonts, and design.
- **API:** You will use the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to get the country data and flag images

## üìù Tips for building your project

1. **Pseudo-code before you write any code!** Look through the designs to plan out how you'll tackle the project. Write down your plan somewhere in this README or in your code.
2. **Work on one feature at a time.** Finish one feature first before you move onto the next thing. Test as you go, routinely checking your site in the browser and making sure there are no errors before moving on. 
3. **Write comments throughout your code as a favor for future you!** You will be building on top of this project over the course of 3 months. Future you will have to come back and re-read all of the code you are going to write. Help future you understand your code by writing comments to explain what each line of code is doing. 


## üöÄ Roadmap: Step-by-step guide to building your project

### Step 1: Project Setup

1. Fork this Github repo into your own Github account, then clone your new Github repo into your local machine. You can use this [fork and clone guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18jxCUA0bebCyYaIHy8aaKMgOQH4w5-b-iCGDWpV4K4M/edit?tab=t.55gk3qetux2a#heading=h.wbbot8ebr58a) to help you.
2. In the terminal, use `cd` to navigate to your new local repo called countries-api-project-may-2025.
3. In the terminal, `cd` into the `version-0` folder, and then create a new React project with [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
4. Push your code to Github!

### Step 2: Display Country Data from `data.json` file

1. In App.jsx, display country data from the `data.json` file
2. Style the country data according to the Figma designs
3. Don't forget to push your code to Github!

### Step 3: Create API Call to REST Countries API

1. In App.jsx, create API call that pulls countries data from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) using useEffect
2. Display countries data from API call on the Home page, instead of displaying data from `data.json`
3. Push your code to Github!

### Step 4: Create Header

1. Create the Header component, which will be displayed on each page.
2. Style the Header component
3. Push your code to Github!

### Stretch Goals (optional ‚Äî only do these if you have completed _all_ of the above steps)

1. Once you've completed Version 0, check out the instructions for Version 1 to keep building your app!
