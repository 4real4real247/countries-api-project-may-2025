# Countries API Application - Version 4

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Instead of using Supabase, you'll build the backend from scratch in Version 4.
Youâ€™ll set up a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin, and build a server with Node.js and Express to handle requests for storing and retrieving data.

This version gives you hands-on experience building and connecting your own backend services.
